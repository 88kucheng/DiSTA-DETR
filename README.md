# Enhanced Infrared Small-Object Detection in UAV Imagery: DiSTA-DETR with Dilated-Sparse Thermal Attention

The overall network architecture of the model is specified in model/DiSTA-DETR.yaml. 
The implementation details of the three core modules—EDTA, EGCA, and HSE—can be found in the following files:
